# LED-flasher-circuit-using-UJT
LED flashing circuit built using a UJT to showcase timing and oscillator fundamentals.
# Overview
This project implements a basic LED flasher using a Unijunction Transistor (UJT) operating as a relaxation oscillator.
The UJT periodically charges and discharges a timing capacitor, producing pulses that turn the LED ON and OFF at a steady rate.
# Components Used

UJT 

LED

100 Ω resistor

5 kΩ resistor

100 µF capacitor

Breadboard & wires

DC supply 9V
# Working Principle
1. The timing capacitor charges through a resistor.

2. When the voltage reaches the UJT trigger point, the UJT conducts.

3. The capacitor discharges rapidly → LED flashes.

4. The cycle repeats, forming a continuous blinking effect.
# Applications
